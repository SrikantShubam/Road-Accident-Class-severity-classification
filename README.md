# 🚦 *Project : Road Traffic Severity Classification*
## Welcome to the Road Accident Severity Classification project! This is a machine learning project that aims to classify the severity of road accidents based on various features. The project is implemented in Python, using various libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.


🧾**Description:** This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments for master's research 
work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017-20. 
All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. 
Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the 
accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms. 



🧭 **Problem Statement:** The target feature is **Accident\_severity** which is a multi-class variable.
 
## 📈  Deployment
 You can find a live deployment of the model on pythonanywhere at this link: [http://roadseverity.pythonanywhere.com/](http://roadseverity.pythonanywhere.com/)
 
##  🛠️	Project Structure

The project consists of several Jupyter notebooks that take the dataset through various stages of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. The notebooks demonstrate how to handle missing values, perform one-hot encoding, and scale features. The project uses multiple machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to train and evaluate the models' performance.

## 📊 Model Performance

The main objective of this project is to predict the severity of road accidents accurately. The severity of accidents is classified into three categories: fatal, serious, and slight. The project uses various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the models' performance.
